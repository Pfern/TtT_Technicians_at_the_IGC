Here we will follow the content of OSTH, the FOSTER Open Science Training Handbook (The chapteer is "On Learning and Training").

As appropriate, we will launch challenges in the room, so that you can see the concepts and their articulation in practice


## Why are we concerned with training?

Training aims at effectiveness in:

- Rapidly transmitting skills 

- Creating deserved self confidence in learners

We want training to complement formal learning. Optimal training provision requires good methodological practice.

## Active learning

      “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.” – Confucius

“Learners who actively engage with course materials will end up retaining it for much longer than they would have otherwise, and they will be better able to apply their knowledge broadly.” (Waldrop, Nature 2015).

Please take a note on the important concepts, and let us discuss it!

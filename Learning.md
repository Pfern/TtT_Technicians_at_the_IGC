Here we will follow the content of the FOSTER Open Science Training Handbook (On Learning and Training).

As appropriate, we will launch challenges in the room, so that you can see the concepts and their articulation in practice


## Why are we concerned with training?

Training aims at effectiveness in:

- Rapidly transmitting skills 

- Creating deserved self confidence in learners

We want training to complement formal learning. Optimal training provision requires good methodological practice.

## Active learning

      “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.” – Confucius

“Learners who actively engage with course materials will end up retaining it for much longer than they would have otherwise, and they will be better able to apply their knowledge broadly.” (Waldrop, Nature 2015).

Please take a note on the important concepts, and let us discuss it!



## Designing training

## Objectives vs Outcomes

In the attempt of removing ambiguities we will use the term #Teaching Objectives to mean:

Objectives describe the goals and intentions of the instructor.
Objectives, often termed the input in the course, state the purpose and goals of the course.
Objectives focus on content and skills important within the classroom or programme.
Objectives may describe what the instructors will do.
Objectives can often be numerous, specific, and detailed.

And the term #Learning Oucomes to mean:

Student Learning Outcomes catalog the overarching “products” of the course and are the evidence that the goals or objectives were achieved.
Learning Outcomes are statements that describe or list measurable and essential mastered content-knowledge—reflecting skills, competencies, and knowledge that students have achieved and can demonstrate upon successfully completing a course.
Outcomes express higher-level thinking skills that integrate course content and activities and can be observed as a behavior, skill, or discrete useable knowledge upon completing the course.
Outcomes are exactly what assessments are intended to show – specifically what the student will be able to do upon completing the course.
An assessable outcome can be displayed or observed and evaluated against criteria.
Outcomes are clear and measurable criteria for guiding the teaching, learning, and assessment process in the course.

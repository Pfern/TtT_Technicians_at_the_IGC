# TtT_for_Technicians_at_the_IGC

This one day course consists of interactively exposing lab technicians to optimised ways of training preparation and delivery. It will have very short presentations followed by interactive exercises. The focus will be the training of users (here named as learners) and its optimisation. The examples will illustrate good practices in facility usage and data production. It is expected that participants will cooperate in using the outcomes to optimise their own training routines and, if possible, influence the adequate operation procedures regarding training, namely when training other technicians.

## Learning Objectives:

• To get acquainted with learning principles and how they apply to training

• To be able to select and utilise training techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation

• To learn how to use assessment and feedback in training

• To learn about session, course, and materials design

## Learning Outcomes:
• Learners can tell which learning principles a good trainer should have in mind
• Learners can describe at least three training techniques drawing on learning principles
• Learners can design a training session and a course
• Learners can develop assessment questionnaires
• Learners can tell what types of material are needed for each part of a training session
